We model a decision impact pathway is for school gardens as a general intervention for sustainable children's food environments in urban Hanoi, Vietnam (Whitney et al. 2024). 

![](figures/outline.png)

**Conceptual model of school gardens as an intervention. Should urban Hanoi school boards invest time and money in creating school gardens? Should they invest in formal STEM education as part of these gardens?**

# Urban Hanoi school garden 

Simulation of the school garden intervention options:

```{r mcsimulation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Source our model
source("CODAS_Garden_Model.R")

# Ensure consistent results with the random number generator
# not for each 'run' of the MC simulation but for 
# consistency each time we run the entire simulation 
set.seed(1234) 

garden_simulation_results <- mcSimulation(
  estimate = estimate_read_csv("data/inputs_school_garden.csv"),
  model_function = school_garden_function,
  numberOfModelRuns = 1e4, #run 10,000 times
  functionSyntax = "plainNames"
)

```

The Net Present Value (i.e. current value of the future benefits) of the garden decision options over `r garden_simulation_results$x$number_of_years[1]` years of the intervention. For public and private schools the STEM costs are considered to be in the same garden space but with the additional costs and benefits of a full STEM education program. All options are compared to the same years of using the land for something that is not related to the garden, i.e. as a playground or for parking. Here we plot the distribution for the decision and frame the projected NPV. 

```{r plot_dist, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("functions/plot_distributions.R")
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = garden_simulation_results, 
                                    vars = c("NPV_garden","NPV_garden_STEM", 
                                             "NPV_garden_public_school", 
                                             "NPV_garden_STEM_public_school"),
                                    method = 'smooth_simple_overlay', 
                                    base_size = 7, 
                                    x_axis_name = "Comparative NPV outcomes")
```

The same results as boxplots: 

```{r plot_boxplot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("functions/plot_distributions.R")
plot_distributions(mcSimulation_object = garden_simulation_results, 
                                    vars = c("NPV_garden","NPV_garden_STEM", "NPV_garden_public_school", "NPV_garden_STEM_public_school"),
                                    method = "boxplot", 
                                    base_size = 7, 
                                    x_axis_name = "Comparative NPV outcomes")

# Paretto front

These figures display the Pareto-optimal solutions, representing the best trade-offs among the objectives of biodiversity, child health, and economic return. By focusing on these Pareto-optimal points, the analysis highlights solutions where improvements in one objective cannot be achieved without some compromise in at least one other. This approach aids decision-makers in visualizing and evaluating only the most efficient options, helping to balance biodiversity conservation, community health, and economic benefits effectively in the decision-making process.

# Input data for the simulations 

## Summary

Here we provide a summary of the garden intervention options. We do this with a summary table of the simulation results. We show the percentage of missing values as well as the mean, median and standard deviation (SD) for each output of our model simulations. We use the `gt_plt_summary()` from {gtExtras} and with options from {svglite}. The table shows the  name, the plot overview as well as the number of missing values, the mean, median and the standard deviation of the distribution for all variables that were fed into the model from our input table of uncertainty values. 

```{r gtExtras_summary_x, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) to summarize only on the variables that we want.
# names(garden_simulation_results$x)
mcSimulation_table_x <- data.frame(garden_simulation_results$x[4:7,21:30]) #,
 # names(garden_simulation_results$y)

 gtExtras::gt_plt_summary(mcSimulation_table_x) 
# a summary table with missing, mean, median and sd

```

<!-- The table shows the variable name, the plot overview as well as the number of missing values, the mean, median and the standard deviation of the distribution for all variables that were calculated in the model.  -->
